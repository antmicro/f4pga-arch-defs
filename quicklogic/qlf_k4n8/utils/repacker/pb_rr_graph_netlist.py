    This function builds a packed netlist fragment given an annotated (with
    nets) CLB graph. The created netlist fragment will be missing information:

      - Atom block names
      - Atom block attributes and parameters

    The missing information has to be supplied externally as it is not stored
    within a graph.

    The first step is to create the block hierarchy (without any ports yet).
    This is done by scanning the graph and creating blocks for nodes that
    belong to nets. Only those nodes are used here.

    The second stage is open block insertion. Whenever a non-leaf is in use
    it should have all of its children present. Unused ones should be makred
    as "open".

    The third stage is adding ports to the blocks and connectivity information.
    To gather all necessary information all the nodes of the graph are needed.

    The final step is leaf block name assignment. Leaf blocks get their names
    based on nets they drive. A special case is a block representing an output
    that doesn't drive anything. Such blocks get names based on their inputs
    but prefixed with "out:".
