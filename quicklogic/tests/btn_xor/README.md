# A combinational XOR function of two inputs.

This test implements a XOR function which inputs are connected to `FBIO_0` and `FBIO_1`. The output is connected to a LED on the `FBIO_21` pad.

The "btn_xor-ql-chandalar-top" variant uses only the top part of the FPGA grid hence the output is connected to the `FBIO_9` pad.
