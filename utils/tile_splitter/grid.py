""" Grid splitting model with connection database back references.

The Grid object provides methods to manipulate a 2D grid of Tile objects, that
contain zero or more Site objects. Site objects are considered immutable.

To construct the Grid object, the initial grid and an empty_tile_type_pkey must
be provided.  The initial grid should be provided as a map of 2 element int

    Attributes
    ----------
    root_phy_tile_pkeys : list of ints
        The list of root_phy_tile_pkey's.

        By default a tile typically has one root phy_tile_pkey, which is the
        phy_tile this initial represents.

        If two Tile objects are merged, the root_phy_tile_pkeys are also merged.
        If a Tile object is split, only one of the split tiles will take all
        of the root_phy_tile_pkeys, and the other tiles will have no
        root_phy_tile_pkeys.

        Invariant: Each phy_tile_pkey will appear in 1 and only 1 Tile
        object's root_phy_tile_pkeys list.

        Because of the invariant, the root_phy_tile_pkeys list can be used as
        a default assignment of children of the relevant phy_tile_pkey items
        (e.g. wires, pips, sites, etc).

    phy_tile_pkeys : list of ints
        The list of phy_tile_pkey's.  This is the list of all phy_tile_pkey's
        that are involved in this tile via either a tile merge or split.

        By default a tile typically has one phy_tile_pkey, which is the
        phy_tile this initial represents.

        If two Tile objects are split, all output tiles will get a copy of the
        original phy_tile_pkeys list.  This attribute can be used to determine
        what phy_tile_pkeys were used to make this tile.

    sites : list of Site objects
        This is the list of Site's contained within this tile.  This should
        be initial set to the Site objects contained within the original
        phy_tile.

        Invariant: Each Site object will be contained within exactly one Tile
        object.

    split_sites : boolean
        True if this tile was split.

        Invariant: Each split tile will contain exactly one Site object.
        Invariant: Two tiles that were split cannot be merged, otherwise the
        resulting Tile will have two Sites, potentially from different
        phy_tile_pkey, which cannot be presented using FASm prefixes.

    neighboors : Map of Direction to Tile object
        Linked list pointers to neighboors tiles.

        Invariant: Underlying linked link should be rectangular after an
        operation on the grid.  An single operation on the Tile will typically
        invalidate the overall grid, it is up to the Grid object to enforce
        the rectangular constraint.

        Invariant: Underlying linked link must not be circular.
